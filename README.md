# Crypto Utility Project

This project contains encryption and decryption utility classes that suppors both AES and RSA algorithm. 

A use case is provided in test that describes how a message is encrypted, passed and decrypted from the source or normally terminal application to the receiving or normally secured server side application.

## Features

 - AES key generation
 - AES encryption
 - AES decryption
 - RSA public / private key generation
 - RSA encryption
 - RSA decryption
